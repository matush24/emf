# Movement of charged particle in electromagnetic field

In this project we are simulating movement of charged particle in electromagnetic field.
We get interesting results,both coresponding and contradicting intuition (at least my own).
Particle moves in circle and speed in the direction of magnetic field remains same.
The contraintuitive part is the introduction of electric field,
particle starts to drift in direction perpendicular to both magnetic and electric field.
Direction of drift turns out to be independent od the charge, which is another nonintuitive result (in my opinion).
